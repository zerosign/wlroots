/**
 * A synchronization timeline.
 *
 * Timelines are used to synchronize accesses to buffers. Given a producer
 * (writing contents to a buffer) and a consumer (reading from the buffer), the
 * compositor needs to synchronize back-and-forth between these two users. The
 * consumer needs to wait for the producer to signal that they're done with the
 * writes, and the producer needs to wait for the consumer to signal that
 * they're done with the reads.
 *
 * Timelines provide synchronization points in the form of monotonically
 * increasing 64-bit integer values.
 *
 * wlroots timelines are designed after Vulkan timeline semaphores. For more
 * information on the Vulkan APIs, see:
 * https://www.khronos.org/blog/vulkan-timeline-semaphores
 *
 * wlroots timelines are powered by DRM synchronization objects (drm_syncobj):
 * https://dri.freedesktop.org/docs/drm/gpu/drm-mm.html#drm-sync-objects
